# Test Strategy - Texas Etiquette Online Presence Revitalization

## Introduction & Overview

### Purpose:

This document outlines the comprehensive test strategy and high-level plan for verifying the quality, functionality, and non-functional aspects of the Texas Etiquette website revitalization project. The primary goal of the initial testing phase is the thorough validation of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to ensure it meets defined business objectives, functional requirements, user needs, and release criteria before launch. Subsequent phases will address testing for iterative enhancements.

### Scope:

- **Overall Product Scope:** Development of a new custom Next.js website including informational pages, online booking/payment, foundational local SEO, "modernized formal" design, and technical infrastructure. Future scope includes blog, testimonials, potential e-commerce, and advanced accessibility.
- **MVP Testing Scope:** Focuses exclusively on features, user stories, and requirements for the MVP release (PRD MVP Scope, User Stories MVP-STORY-01 to MVP-STORY-23, SPEC MVP Technical Scope). This includes:
  - Core website platform functionality.
  - Essential informational pages (Homepage, About, Contact, Service Overviews, core Service Detail Pages).
  - End-to-end user journey: Service discovery -> Evaluation -> Availability -> Booking -> Payment -> UI & Email Confirmation.
  - Contact Form functionality.
  - Foundational "Modernized Formal" design and responsiveness.
  - Foundational Local SEO technical setup.
  - Core Non-Functional Requirements for MVP (Performance, Security, Basic Usability/Navigation, Foundational Accessibility, Compatibility).
- **Post-MVP Testing Scope:** Iteratively cover new features (blog, testimonials, full accessibility, etc.) and include regression testing.
- **Out of Scope (for MVP Testing):** Full blog content/management UI, dedicated testimonials section, full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance audit, e-commerce, advanced CRM, advanced admin dashboard, advanced SEO, detailed server-side analytics, load/stress testing beyond MVP NFRs.

### Goals (MVP Focus):

- Verify all MVP User Stories meet Acceptance Criteria and Definition of Done.
- Validate successful completion of the core MVP user journey.
- Confirm correct and secure integration with third-party Booking and Payment systems.
- Ensure MVP meets NFRs for performance, security, responsiveness, basic accessibility, and compatibility.
- Identify and report defects, prioritizing critical/high-severity issues.
- Provide confidence that the MVP meets Exit Criteria and is ready for release.
- Establish a baseline regression suite.

## Test Approach & Methodology

### Overall Strategy:

Risk-based testing (RBT) prioritizing critical MVP features (booking/payment). Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles using Gherkin Acceptance Criteria. Continuous Testing integrated into CI/CD where applicable.

### Testing Levels & Types (MVP Focus):

- **Unit Testing:** (Dev Team) Individual components, functions, API route logic, service integration modules.
- **Integration Testing:** (QA/SDET/Devs) Interactions between components and external systems.
  - API Testing: Next.js API routes (/api/contact, /api/confirm-booking).
  - Third-Party Integration Points: Interaction with Booking/Payment systems (staging/test).
  - Component Interactions: Key frontend components in booking flow.
- **System Testing:** (QA Team) End-to-end testing of complete MVP user journeys. Simulates real user scenarios.
- **Acceptance Testing (MVP):**
  - User Acceptance Testing (UAT): (Business Owner) Validates MVP meets business needs. Focus on booking/payment and content.
  - Business Acceptance Testing (BAT): (Business Owner) Validates MVP achieves intended business goals.
- **Exploratory Testing:** (QA Team) Time-boxed sessions to uncover defects not found via scripted testing.
- **Regression Testing (MVP):** Suite focusing on core MVP functionality (booking/payment, contact form, core navigation). Key flows targeted for automation.

## Scope of Testing (Detailed - MVP Prioritized)

### Functional Testing (MVP):

Based on Acceptance Criteria of MVP User Stories MVP-STORY-01 through MVP-STORY-23.

### Non-Functional Testing (MVP):

- **Performance Testing:** Verify Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID/INP, CLS) for key pages. Basic API response time checks.
- **Security Testing:** Verify HTTPS, secure payment gateway integration, server-side input validation, basic security headers, SCA/SAST scans, log review.
- **Usability Testing:** Covered via UAT and exploratory testing; focus on navigation and booking/payment flow.
- **Accessibility Testing:** Manual checks for foundational requirements (keyboard nav, focus, semantics, alt text, labels).
- **Compatibility Testing:** Core functional tests on specified desktop browsers and mobile/tablet viewports/emulators.
- **Reliability/Recovery Testing:** Basic checks for network interruptions during booking/payment; confirmation email reliability.

## Test Environments (MVP Support)

- **Development Environment:** Local setups with mocked/sandboxed third-party services.
- **QA / Staging Environment:** Mirrors production. For Integration, System, NFR, Regression Testing. Requires test/sandbox accounts for Booking/Payment Gateways.
- **UAT Environment:** QA/Staging or separate clean environment for Business Owner UAT.
- **Production Environment:** Live environment for post-launch monitoring and smoke testing.
- **Configuration Management:** Hosting platform features (e.g., Vercel) and environment variables.
- **Data Strategy (Environments):** Generated/masked test data for QA/Staging. Representative test data by Business Owner for UAT.

## Test Data Management (MVP Focus)

### Data Needs:

Valid/invalid inputs for Contact and Booking Forms. Representative Service details. Test credit card numbers (from Payment Gateway sandbox). Test date/time slots (from Booking System sandbox).

### Generation/Source:

Manual or tool-generated form data. Payment/booking data from third-party sandboxes.

### Data Privacy/Security:

No real PII in test environments. Generated data for names, emails, phones. Test credit cards are non-real.

### Maintenance:

Test data (booking slots, payment cards) may need periodic refreshing.

## Test Automation Strategy (MVP Prioritized)

### Scope (MVP):

- **API Tests:** Next.js API routes (/api/contact, /api/confirm-booking).
- **Unit/Component Tests:** Developer-led for critical logic and UI components.
- **E2E Tests:** Core "happy path" of booking/payment flow; Contact Form submission.
- **Core Regression Suite:** Automated E2E and API tests.

### Tools & Frameworks:

- **API Testing:** Postman, Bun Test Runner / Jest + Supertest.
- **E2E Testing:** Cypress or Playwright (TBD).
- **Unit/Component Testing:** Jest, React Testing Library (RTL).
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automated tests run on commits/pull requests.

### Goals (MVP):

Rapid feedback on core flow stability. Ensure critical API endpoints meet contracts. Build foundational regression suite. Verify "happy paths."

## Defect Management Process

- **Tool:** Jira (or similar Agile tool - TBD).
- **Workflow:** New -> Open/Triage -> In Progress -> Resolved/Fixed -> Ready for Retest -> Retesting -> Closed / Reopened.
- **Prioritization:** Severity (technical impact) and Priority (business impact).
  - Severity 1 (Blocking)
  - Severity 2 (Critical)
  - Severity 3 (Major)
  - Severity 4 (Minor)
  - Severity 5 (Trivial)
