# UI Specification - Texas Etiquette Online Presence Revitalization

## Introduction & Overview

### Purpose:
This document defines the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design specifications for the Texas Etiquette website revitalization project. It translates requirements from the PRD and SRS into actionable design guidelines for visual layout, interaction, style, accessibility, and core components, forming the basis for a consistent design system. This specification covers the core features outlined for the MVP, including informational pages, service browsing, and the online booking/payment flow.

### Design Goals:

* **Enhance Brand Perception:** Establish a professional, trustworthy, "modernized formal" aesthetic reflecting expertise.
* **Streamline Operations:** Provide a seamless, intuitive, and efficient online booking and payment process.
* **Increase Client Acquisition:** Create clear pathways for users to find, understand, and book services.
* **Usability & Accessibility:** Ensure the website is easy to navigate, understand, and use for the target audience, incorporating basic accessibility best practices.
* **Security & Trust:** Design the UI to promote user trust, handle data securely (especially during booking/payment), and provide clear feedback.

## Overarching Design Principles & Heuristics

* **Simplicity & Clarity:** Prioritize clear communication and intuitive interfaces. Minimize cognitive load.
* **Consistency:** Maintain internal and external consistency in layout, navigation, terminology, and component behavior.
* **Efficiency:** Enable users to achieve goals quickly and with minimal effort.
* **Feedback:** Provide clear and timely feedback for user actions and system status changes.
* **Accessibility (Foundational):** Design with basic accessibility in mind (contrast, keyboard navigation, semantic structure).
* **Security by Design:** Integrate security considerations into the UI (secure processes, careful data handling).

### Key User Flow: Online Booking & Payment

1.  User clicks "Book Now" on Service Detail page.
2.  UI navigates to/reveals Booking step.
3.  User selects available date/time.
4.  UI confirms selection, proceeds to information input.
5.  User fills required information (Name, Email, Phone).
6.  User clicks "Proceed to Payment."
7.  Server validates inputs. If valid, proceeds to payment step. Order summary displayed.
8.  User interacts with secure payment gateway element.
9.  User clicks "Pay Now" / "Confirm Booking."
10. UI displays processing. Payment submitted via gateway.
11. **Success:** UI displays Confirmation page/message. Email confirmation sent.
12. **Failure:** UI displays clear error message and guidance.

## Accessibility Implementation Guidelines

* **Conformance Goal:** Aim for WCAG 2.1 Level AA principles for MVP (foundational).
* **Color Contrast:** Meet AA requirements (4.5:1 normal text, 3:1 large text/graphics).
* **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements navigable and operable via keyboard. Logical tab order.
* **Visible Focus Indicator:** Clear, highly visible focus outline.
* **ARIA Roles & Attributes:** Use appropriately for custom components/dynamic content.
* **Alternative Text:** Descriptive alt text for meaningful images. Empty `alt=""` for decorative.
* **Semantic HTML:** Use elements according to their meaning (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<h1>-<h6>`, `<button>`, etc.).

## Responsive Design Strategy

* **Approach:** Mobile-first recommended, ensure polished experience across viewports.
* **Breakpoints (Example):**
    * Mobile: < 768px
    * Tablet: 768px - 1024px
    * Desktop: 1025px - 1440px
    * Large Desktop: > 1440px
* **Adaptation:**
    * **Layout:** Single-column to multi-column transitions.
    * **Navigation:** Hamburger menu to full horizontal menu.
    * **Components:** Tappable buttons/inputs on mobile.
    * **Typography:** Slight size adjustments for readability.
    * **Interaction:** Hover interactions have touch alternatives or are non-essential on mobile.

## Open Issues / Design Questions

* **ISSUE-01:** Final selection of third-party Booking System and Payment Gateway providers pending.
* **DEPEND-02:** Finalized branding guidelines (colors, typography, logo) required.
* **Accessibility:** Confirm specific WCAG 2.1 AA requirements to prioritize for MVP.
* **Content:** Availability of finalized website copy and imagery impacts layout (DEPEND-01).
* **Error Scenarios:** Need detailed definition of specific error messages for booking/payment failures.
