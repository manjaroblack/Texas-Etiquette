# Pricing Landscape of the Etiquette Consulting Market

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes pricing structures and typical costs in the etiquette consulting market. A key finding is the **impracticality of a single Average Service Price (ASP)** due to significant market heterogeneity. Pricing varies substantially based on service type, consultant expertise/reputation, location, and delivery mode (in-person vs. virtual).

Common pricing models include hourly rates, project-based/fixed fees, daily rates, per-person charges, and retainers. Indicative price ranges:

- Individual coaching: ~$40/hr (beginner) to $500+/hr (top expert).
- Corporate workshops: $1,000 (shorter) to $10,000+ (full-day/multi-day, seasoned professional).
- Online courses: Start under $50; comprehensive certifications can be several thousand dollars.

The business etiquette training segment shows robust growth, driven by globalization, hybrid work models, Gen Z integration, and focus on soft skills. This supports diverse and premium pricing. Pricing transparency is often limited, with many consultants requiring direct contact for quotes.

Customization and in-person delivery, especially for corporate clients, command a premium. Standardized online offerings are more accessible, but bespoke, high-touch services have higher fees.

## Key Factors Influencing Etiquette Consulting Pricing

- **Consultant Experience, Reputation, and Credentials:** Seasoned experts with strong profiles charge more. Certifications add credibility.
- **Geographic Location:** Higher rates in major metropolitan areas with higher cost of living/demand.
- **Target Audience and Client Type:** Corporate clients generally have larger budgets than individuals or non-profits. Youth programs are a distinct segment.
- **Service Customization and Scope Complexity:** Tailored programs cost more than standardized offerings.
- **Delivery Mode (In-Person vs. Virtual):** In-person often priced higher (travel, venue), but high-value virtual training exists.
- **Inclusion of Materials, Meals, or Venue:** Adds to cost.
- **Group Size:** Per-participant cost often decreases for larger groups, but overall project fee can be substantial.

Consultants price based on operational costs, expertise, market rates, and value proposition.

## Consultant Compensation as a Pricing Factor

Consultant salaries provide context but are distinct from client-facing fees. Billing rates must cover business expenses and profit margin, typically 2-3 times the salary-equivalent hourly rate.

- Reported "Etiquette Coach" average hourly wage: ~$21.62.
- Reported "Etiquette Consultant" average hourly wage: ~$49.72.
- Significant geographic variation in salaries.
  The wide salary range (e.g., $27,000 to $192,000+ annually) mirrors the diverse service pricing.
