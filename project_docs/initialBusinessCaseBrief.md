The primary objective is to leverage a new, optimized website and targeted digital strategies to attract more clients, enhance brand perception, streamline operations, and ultimately drive significant business growth within the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas market.

**Key Findings:** The previous website associated with the business was outdated and potentially inaccessible¹, rendering it non-functional for attracting or serving clients effectively. This requires creating an entirely new online platform.

Success requires a modern, user-friendly website incorporating essential functionalities, particularly seamless online booking⁷, coupled with a robust local Search Engine Optimization (SEO) strategy specifically targeting the Dallas-Fort Worth area.⁹

**Core Recommendations:** It is recommended to develop a new, custom website using modern technologies like Next.js to achieve maximum performance, flexibility, and SEO potential, integrating best-in-class third-party services for booking and payments. The website must feature a modernized formal design aligned with the Texas Etiquette brand's unique selling proposition, intuitive navigation, compelling content, integrated online scheduling, and secure payment processing (for service deposits/full amounts). A focused local SEO campaign, centered around optimizing a Google Business Profile (using the official name Texas Etiquette LLC) and building local citations, is critical for attracting clients in Dallas-Fort Worth.

**Expected Outcome:** Implementing these recommendations will result in a professional, high-performing digital presence that effectively attracts and converts local clients searching for etiquette services. This revitalized online platform will improve brand credibility, streamline the booking and payment process, establish the business owner as an expert, and serve as a powerful engine for sustainable business growth in the competitive Texas market.
