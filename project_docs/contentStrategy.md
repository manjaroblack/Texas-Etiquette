# Content Strategy - Texas Etiquette Online Presence Revitalization

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the content strategy for the Texas Etiquette website revitalization, with a primary focus on delivering the essential content required for a successful Minimum Viable Product (MVP) launch. The MVP's goal is to establish a professional online presence, enable core online booking and payment functionality for key services targeting the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) market, and validate this core user journey with early adopters. The strategy leverages structured content principles, prioritizes user needs derived from defined personas, aligns with the "modernized formal" aesthetic, and incorporates plans for data-driven optimization post-launch. The immediate priority is ensuring clarity, usability, and trust through high-quality UI microcopy, foundational page content, and essential booking/confirmation messaging for the MVP. This initial content effort will establish a scalable foundation (structured models, voice) to support future content expansion and marketing goals.
