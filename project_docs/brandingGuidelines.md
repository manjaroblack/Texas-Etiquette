# Branding Guidelines - Texas Etiquette Online Presence Revitalization

These guidelines define the core visual elements for the revitalized Texas Etiquette online presence, aiming for a sophisticated, modern, and trustworthy "modernized formal" aesthetic.

## Color Palette

The palette balances traditional formality with modern clarity.

- **Primary (Deep Navy):** `#1A2B45`
  - **Usage:** Main headings, primary buttons, key accents, footer background. Evokes trust, stability, and sophistication.
- **Secondary (Warm Beige):** `#F5F0E6`
  - **Usage:** Background sections, subtle highlights. Provides warmth and a clean, neutral base.
- **Accent (Sophisticated Gold):** `#C0A062`
  - **Usage:** Call-to-action buttons (hover/secondary), key highlights, subtle graphic elements. Adds a touch of elegance without being overly ornate.
- **Neutral (Off-White):** `#FCFCFA`
  - **Usage:** Main background color for content areas. Ensures high readability and a clean look.
- **Text (Dark Charcoal):** `#333333`
  - **Usage:** Body text, secondary headings. Offers strong contrast against light backgrounds for readability.
- **White:** `#FFFFFF`
  - **Usage:** Text on dark backgrounds (buttons, footer), icons.

## Typography

We will use two primary fonts sourced from Google Fonts for broad compatibility and ease of use.

- **Headings Font (Serif):** `Playfair Display`
  - **Usage:** Main page titles (H1), section headings (H2, H3).
  - **Weights:** Regular (400), Bold (700).
  - **Characteristics:** Elegant, high-contrast serif font that conveys formality and style.
  - **Example:** `font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;`
- **Body Font (Sans-serif):** `Inter`
  - **Usage:** Paragraph text, labels, navigation links, button text, captions.
  - **Weights:** Regular (400), Medium (500), Semi-Bold (600).
  - **Characteristics:** Highly readable, clean, modern sans-serif suitable for UI elements and longer text passages.
  - **Example:** `font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;`

## Logo Concept

The logo should move away from the complex script of the old design towards a cleaner, more modern representation.

- **Concept:** A sophisticated wordmark logo.
  - "**TEXAS**" in a clean, slightly wider-tracked sans-serif font (perhaps related to Inter or a similar geometric sans-serif) in the primary Deep Navy color (`#1A2B45`).
  - "**ETIQUETTE**" below it, potentially in the Playfair Display serif font, slightly smaller, also in Deep Navy or Dark Charcoal (`#333333`).
- **Optional Subtle Element:** A single, minimalist five-pointed star (perhaps using the Accent Gold `#C0A062` or subtly integrated) positioned tastefully, maybe to the left or integrated near the 'X' in Texas, to hint at the location without being overt or clich√©.
- **Variations:**
  - **Primary:** Full-color version as described above.
  - **Monochrome:** All-white version for use on dark backgrounds (e.g., footer). All-navy or all-charcoal version for specific applications.
  - **Icon/Favicon:** A simplified version, potentially just the stylized star element or a monogram ("TE").

These guidelines should provide a solid foundation for the visual design of the new website, ensuring consistency and reflecting the desired brand image.
