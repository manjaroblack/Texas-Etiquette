# Marketing Plan - Texas Etiquette Online Presence Revitalization

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the marketing and go-to-market strategy for the launch of the new Texas Etiquette LLC online presence, focusing initially on the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The project aims to replace an outdated, non-functional website with a modern, custom-built Next.js platform to increase client acquisition, enhance brand perception, and streamline operations within the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) market. The target audience includes parents, professionals, and individuals in the DFW area seeking etiquette training.

The MVP focuses on launching the core website with essential information (About, Services, Contact), enabling online booking and payment for initial core services, and establishing foundational local SEO presence. The primary goal of the MVP launch is to validate the core online booking/payment functionality with early adopters, gather crucial user feedback, and establish a baseline digital footprint.

The GTM motion for the MVP will involve targeted outreach to identified early adopter personas within DFW, driven primarily by an optimized Google Business Profile (GBP) and foundational local SEO. Elements of Product-Led Growth (PLG) via the self-serve booking feature and Community-Led Growth (CLG) through hyper-local targeting and feedback gathering will be employed initially. Post-MVP, the strategy will scale using PLG, CLG, and potentially Sales-Led Growth (SLG) for business clients, supported by a broader content and digital marketing mix. The expected outcome of the MVP launch is a functional, validated online booking system, initial user acquisition, and actionable insights for future iterations.
