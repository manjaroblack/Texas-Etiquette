## Acceptance Criteria Principles / Examples

- **Standard Format:** Gherkin (Given/When/Then) for detailed user stories.
- **Collaborative Derivation:** Use techniques like Example Mapping.
- **Illustrative Example (for UC-MVP-04: Book a Service Online):**
  - **Feature:** Online Service Booking
    - **Scenario:** Successfully booking an available service slot
      - Given the user is on the detailed service page for "Teen Etiquette Essentials"
      - And the user clicks the "Book Now" button
      - And the booking calendar shows an available slot on May 15th at 4:00 PM
      - When the user selects the May 15th, 4:00 PM slot
      - And fills in their required contact information (Name, Email, Phone)
      - And proceeds to the payment step
      - Then the system should navigate them to the payment confirmation page/step for that booking.
    - **Scenario:** Attempting to book an unavailable slot
      - Given the user is viewing the booking calendar for "Teen Etiquette Essentials"
      - And the slot for May 16th at 2:00 PM is already booked or unavailable
      - When the user attempts to select the May 16th, 2:00 PM slot
      - Then the system should clearly indicate that the slot is unavailable
      - And the user should not be able to proceed with booking that specific slot.
