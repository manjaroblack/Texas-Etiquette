# Security Requirements Specification (SRS) - Texas Etiquette Online Presence Revitalization

## Introduction & Overview

### Purpose:
This document defines the security requirements for the new Texas Etiquette website. It details the necessary security controls, policies, standards, and threat considerations to protect the system, its data, and its users, based on the business context and product features outlined in the approved BRD and PRD. This specification will guide secure design, development, testing, and operations.

### Security Goals & Objectives:

* **Confidentiality:** Protect sensitive client information (personal details, payment information) from unauthorized disclosure.
* **Integrity:** Ensure the accuracy and trustworthiness of website content, booking information, and payment transactions. Prevent unauthorized modification of data.
* **Availability:** Ensure the website and its core functionalities (especially booking and payment) are available to legitimate users when needed.
* **Compliance:** Adhere to relevant industry standards, particularly PCI DSS requirements related to the handling of payment data via the third-party gateway.
* **Trust:** Maintain user trust by demonstrating a commitment to security and privacy.

## Secure Design Principles

* **Least Privilege:** Access rights limited to only those necessary.
* **Defense in Depth:** Layered security controls.
* **Secure Defaults:** Configurations default to the most secure options.
* **Fail Securely:** System defaults to a secure state in case of failures.
* **Minimize Attack Surface:** Disable or remove unnecessary features, ports, services.
* **Separation of Duties:** Separate roles and responsibilities where applicable.
* **Do Not Trust User Input:** Validate and sanitize all input.
* **Security by Design:** Integrate security into all development lifecycle phases.

## Threat Modeling (High-Level)

### Threat Actors:

* External Attackers (Opportunistic & Targeted)
* Malicious Insiders (Low Risk/Scope for MVP)
* Third-Party Risk (Booking/Payment Gateway vulnerabilities)

### Key Assets:

* Client Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
* Client Payment Information (handled by third-party)
* Booking/Scheduling Data
* Website Integrity
* Business Reputation
* System Availability

### Attack Vectors/Threat Scenarios (Conceptual STRIDE):

* **(S)poofing:** Impersonation (low risk for MVP without client accounts).
* **(T)ampering:** Unauthorized modification of content, booking, or transaction data.
* **(R)epudiation:** Insufficient logging for tracing actions.
* **(I)nformation Disclosure:** Exposure of PII or payment data.
* **(D)enial of Service:** Overwhelming website or integrations.
* **(E)levation of Privilege:** Gaining unauthorized admin access (relevant with CMS).

## Compliance & Regulatory Requirements

* **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard):**
    * Secure integration with third-party payment gateway.
    * Website must not store, process, or transmit cardholder data in a way that increases scope.
    * Integration method (redirect, iframe) should minimize risk.
* **Data Privacy Laws (Conceptual - General Principles):**
    * **Data Minimization:** Collect only necessary PII.
    * **Transparency:** Clear Privacy Policy.
    * **User Rights:** Mechanism for data inquiries (contact form).

## Data Security Requirements

### Data Classification:

* **Public:** General website content.
* **Internal:** Website configuration files, non-sensitive logs.
* **Confidential:** Client PII (Name, Email, Phone), Booking details.
* **Restricted:** Payment card information (handled **only** by PCI-compliant gateway).

### Encryption:

* **At Rest:** Protect any temporarily stored Confidential data or sensitive configuration data. Primary booking/payment data resides securely in third-party systems.
* **In Transit:** All website traffic MUST be encrypted using TLS 1.2+ (HTTPS). Connections to third-party APIs MUST use TLS 1.2+.
* **Key Management:** Securely manage encryption keys (e.g., via managed cloud services). No hardcoded keys.

### Data Masking/Anonymization:

* Sensitive PII MUST NOT be exposed in logs or error messages. Mask/anonymize for non-production environments.

### Data Handling & Disposal:

* Collect minimum PII. Define retention policies (primary retention by third-parties). Secure deletion for temporary data.

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP):

* Prevent PII leakage via insecure coding or verbose errors.

## Authentication Requirements

### Client Authentication:

* No direct client login accounts for MVP. Authentication via third-party payment gateway.

### Administrative Authentication:

* Strong, unique passwords for CMS/admin backend.
* **Password Policy:** Minimum length (12+), complexity, history, expiration.
* Consider MFA for admin access.
* Account lockout after failed login attempts.
* **Session Management (Admin):** Secure session tokens, short inactivity timeouts, secure cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite).

### Third-Party System Authentication:

* Secure methods (API keys, OAuth) for booking/payment system communication. API keys treated as secrets.

## Authorization & Access Control Requirements

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Admin roles grant only necessary permissions.
* **Access Control Model:** RBAC recommended for CMS user roles.
* **Enforcement:** Server-side authorization checks for admin actions.
* **Administrative Access:** Limit users with full admin privileges. Regular review. Audit logs for admin actions.

## Application Security Requirements

### Input Validation:

* Strict server-side validation of all client/API input (format, type, length, range).
* Defenses against common injection attacks (SQLi, XSS via input).

### Output Encoding:

* Contextually encode all data output to the browser to prevent XSS.

### API Security (Third-Party Integration):

* Securely authenticate calls. Validate data from APIs. Protect API keys. Error handling for integration failures.

### Error Handling:

* Generic error messages to users. Detailed errors logged securely server-side.

### Security Headers:

* Implement HSTS, CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy.

## Secure Development & Dependency Management

### Secure Coding Practices:

* Adhere to recognized secure coding guidelines (OWASP, Bun Security Checklist). Code reviews for security.

### Secrets Management:

* No hardcoded secrets. Use secure secrets management solutions (hosting environment tools, environment variables). Rotation policies.

### Dependency Management (SCA):

* Implement SCA (Bun's integrated security features / Snyk / Dependabot) for third-party library vulnerabilities. Patching policy based on severity. Regular updates.

### CI/CD Integration (DevSecOps):

* Automated security checks: SCA, SAST, secrets scanning.

## Infrastructure & Operational Security Requirements (High-Level)

### Secure Configuration:

* Securely configure/harden underlying server/PaaS environment (CIS Benchmarks). Disable unnecessary services/ports.

### Logging & Monitoring:

* Comprehensive logging (application, security, admin, infrastructure events). Protect logs. Mask sensitive data in logs. Retention periods. Consider centralized logging/alerting.

### Vulnerability Management:

* Regular DAST and infrastructure vulnerability scanning. Patch management process.

### Network Security:

* Network firewalls (security groups). Web Application Firewall (WAF). Basic DDoS protection.

## UI Security Requirements (Conceptual)

* **Forms:** Client-side validation for UX, mandatory server-side validation for security. CSRF protection for sensitive forms.
* **Data Exposure:** Avoid displaying sensitive PII unnecessarily. No sensitive data in client-side code or browser storage.
* **Booking/Payment UI:** Secure integration with third-party systems. Clear indication of third-party interaction.
* **Security Feedback:** Clear feedback for security-related actions (payment success/failure).

## Security Testing Requirements

* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Integrated into CI/CD.
* **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Integrated into CI/CD.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Scans against running application in staging.
* **Integration Testing:** Thorough security testing of third-party integrations.
* **Penetration Testing:** Consider periodic testing by qualified professionals.
* **Remediation:** Process for triaging and remediating vulnerabilities. Critical/High fixed before release.

## Incident Response Enablement Requirements

* **Logging:** Sufficient detail for investigations (IPs, timestamps, actions, errors).
* **Contact Points:** Up-to-date contacts for providers (hosting, domain, third-party services).
* **System Access:** Mechanisms to quickly disable access or isolate components.
* **Backup/Recovery:** Regular, automated, secure backups, tested periodically.
