# Advanced Support Plan & Documentation Strategy: Texas Etiquette MVP

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the support and documentation strategy for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) launch of the new Texas Etiquette website. The vision is to provide efficient, targeted support to early adopters in the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) market, ensuring a smooth initial experience with the core functionality (service discovery, online booking, online payment) and establishing a robust feedback loop.

For the MVP launch, support will be focused primarily through **email and the website contact form**, handled initially by the Business Owner (L1) with escalation to the Web Developer (L2) for technical issues. Self-service will be initiated via a **focused Knowledge Base (KB)** containing essential FAQs and guides for the MVP features, potentially augmented by a very basic **AI chatbot** handling top-tier questions. Documentation will prioritize **essential user guidance** (Quick Start Guide) and foundational **internal technical documentation** (key APIs, MVP runbooks, core architecture) managed using **Docs-as-Code principles** (Markdown in Git repo).

Core MVP support goals include providing timely email responses (within 1 business day), resolving a target percentage of anticipated MVP queries via the KB, achieving a positive initial Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score, and efficiently capturing user feedback to inform rapid iteration. This plan establishes a scalable foundation for support and documentation that will evolve iteratively post-MVP.

## Support Goals & Objectives

### MVP Support Goals:

* **Timely Assistance:** Provide initial response via email/contact form within 1 business day.
* **Self-Service Enablement:** Resolve at least 20% of anticipated MVP-related user questions via the initial Knowledge Base.
* **Efficient Feedback Capture:** Capture and categorize key user feedback, usability issues, and bugs during the first 4 weeks post-launch.
* **Initial Satisfaction:** Achieve an initial average Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score of 4.0/5.0 or higher.
* **Validate Booking Flow:** Successfully support users through the online booking and payment process.

### Post-MVP Support Goals:

* Expand support channels (e.g., dedicated portal, limited phone support).
* Increase self-service resolution rates via KCS methodology.
* Implement more sophisticated AI capabilities.
* Achieve and maintain a higher target CSAT score (e.g., 4.5+).
* Develop proactive support measures.

## Support Scope & Omnichannel Strategy

### MVP Scope:

* Navigating core informational pages.
* Using the online booking system (third-party integration).
* Using the online payment gateway (third-party integration).
* Basic usability and accessibility issues on the MVP site.
* Understanding content on MVP pages.
* **Out of Scope for MVP Support:** Blog functionality, testimonials section features, advanced accessibility beyond MVP basics, e-commerce, expanded online courses.

### MVP Channels:

* **Primary:**
    * Email: Dedicated support email.
    * Website Contact Form: Routed to support email.
* **Secondary (Indirect):**
    * Google Business Profile (GBP) Q&A: Monitor and respond.

### Omnichannel (MVP):

* Basic Context Sharing: Interactions managed within a single email inbox. L1 support (Business Owner) manually reviews previous interactions. No automated context sharing tools for MVP.

## Support Model & Process (AI-Augmented for MVP)

### Tiered Support (MVP):

* **Tier 1 (L1): Business Owner.** Handles initial contact, general inquiries, usability questions, basic troubleshooting (using Internal KB), captures feedback/bugs.
* **Tier 2 (L2): Web Developer/Agency.** Handles technical escalations (bugs, integration failures, performance, security).

### AI Integration (MVP):

* **Basic AI Chatbot (Optional, Phased):** Low-cost widget trained on Top 3-5 MVP FAQs. Goal: Deflect basic questions. Clear escalation path.
* **AI Ticket Tagging (If Helpdesk Used):** Simple AI tagging to categorize requests if a basic helpdesk tool is used.

### Escalation Paths (MVP):

* L1 receives inquiry -> Attempts resolution (personal knowledge, Internal KB).
* If L1 cannot resolve or technical issue: Gathers details -> Escalates to L2 (Developer).
* L2 investigates, resolves, communicates to L1 -> L1 communicates to user. L2 updates Internal KB/Issue Tracker.

### Issue Tracking (MVP):

* **Initial Tool:** Simple shared spreadsheet (Google Sheets) or Kanban board (Trello - free tier).
* **Fields:** Ticket ID, Date, User Email, Summary, Steps to Reproduce, Severity, Status, Assigned To, Resolution.
* **Goal:** Capture, track, prioritize bugs/feedback. Transition to dedicated helpdesk post-MVP.

### SLAs (Service Level Agreements) (MVP):

* Email/Contact Form First Response Time: Within 1 Business Day.
* L1 Resolution Target (non-technical): Within 2 Business Days.
* L2 Escalation Acknowledgement: Within 4 Business Hours.
* L2 Resolution Target (critical MVP bugs): Within 1 Business Day of acknowledgement.

## Self-Service & Knowledge Strategy (KCS & AI Driven for MVP)

**Goal:** Maximize self-service for anticipated MVP user questions.

### KCS Integration (MVP - Basic Loop):

* **Capture:** L1 identifies questions not in KB.
* **Structure:** L1 drafts simple answers.
* **Reuse:** L1 uses draft answers for repeat questions.
* **Improve:** L1 reviews/refines drafts weekly, adds to KB. Basic "Solve Loop."

### AI Chatbot / Virtual Agent (MVP Scope):
