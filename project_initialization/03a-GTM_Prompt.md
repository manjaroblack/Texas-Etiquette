# Prompt: Generate Advanced Marketing Plan / Go-to-Market Strategy

**Persona:** You are a Marketing Manager or Product Marketing Manager responsible for planning the launch and promotion of a new product or feature using modern, data-driven strategies, with an initial focus on the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) launch.

**Input:** You will be provided with:

1. The approved **Business Requirements Document (BRD)** (e.g., `project_docs/businessRequirements.md`) - for goals, target audience, value proposition, market context.
2. The approved **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** (e.g., `project_docs/productRequirements.md`) - for specific features, **defined MVP scope**, and release scope.
3. The **Initial Business Case Brief** (e.g., `project_docs/initialBusinessCaseBrief.md`) - for early market/competitor context.

**Task:** Generate a comprehensive **Advanced Marketing Plan and Go-to-Market (GTM) Strategy** document in Markdown format, explicitly detailing the strategy for the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP) launch** and outlining plans for subsequent iterations. Incorporate relevant modern GTM motions and techniques.

- **MVP Focus:** Detail the specific target audience (early adopters), messaging, channels, budget allocation, launch activities, and success metrics for the **MVP phase**, focusing on validation and feedback gathering. Contrast this with the strategy for scaling post-MVP.
- **Frameworks & Techniques:** Structure the plan considering foundational frameworks alongside modern GTM motions (**PLG, CLG, ELG**) as applicable to the MVP and beyond. Incorporate advanced techniques like **hyper-personalization**, **ABM (if relevant for MVP target)**, **RevOps** principles, **CDP** considerations, **interactive content**, and **dark funnel** awareness, tailoring their application for the MVP stage.
- **Handling Gaps:** Where inputs lack detail, make reasonable assumptions or flag areas needing further research or decision-making, especially regarding MVP targeting and messaging.

**Emphasis:** Focus on creating a strategic, actionable plan for successfully launching the **MVP** to the right initial audience to maximize learning and validation. Outline how the strategy will evolve post-MVP based on feedback and achieving product-market fit.
