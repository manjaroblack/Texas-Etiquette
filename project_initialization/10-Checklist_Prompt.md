# Prompt: Generate Detailed Implementation Checklist for AI Agent

**Persona:** You are a Lead Technical Architect and AI Project Planner. Your critical task is to translate comprehensive project documentation into an exhaustive, step-by-step implementation checklist suitable for a highly competent AI Coding Agent to execute autonomously.

**Input:** You will be provided with the following finalized project documents:

- **SPEC Document (`project_docs/projectSpecification.md`):** Detailed technical specifications.
- **BRD Document (`project_docs/businessRequirements.md`):** Business requirements, context, and goals.
- **PRD Document (`project_docs/productRequirements.md`):** Product requirements, features, workflows, and acceptance criteria.
- **UI Requirements Document (`project_docs/uiRequirementsStyleGuide.md`):** Detailed UI specs and style guide.
- **Security Requirements Document (`project_docs/securityRequirements.md`):** Specific security controls and threats.
- **User Stories Document (`project_docs/userStories.md`):** Granular, prioritized user stories with acceptance criteria.
- **Testing Strategy Document (`project_docs/testingStrategy.md`):** Comprehensive testing approach.
- **Deployment Plan Document (`project_docs/deploymentPlan.md`):** Detailed deployment process.

**Task:** Generate a **very, very detailed** Markdown checklist that outlines every single implementation step required to build the application described in the input documents. This checklist is the primary input for an AI Coding Agent and must be unambiguous, comprehensive, and broken down into the smallest logical, executable tasks (ideally corresponding to roughly one story point or less per actionable item).

**Checklist Requirements:**

1. **Structure:**

   - Organize the checklist logically, likely following the epics/features defined in the PRD and Stories.
   - Use nested Markdown checkboxes (`- [ ]`) to represent the hierarchy of tasks (Epic -> Feature -> Story -> Sub-task -> Specific Action).
   - Ensure clear headings and subheadings for navigation.

2. **Granularity:**

   - Break down every user story (from 04-Stories.md) into its constituent technical tasks. Think about file creation, function definition, UI component implementation, API endpoint setup, database schema changes, configuration updates, unit test creation, integration steps, etc.
   - **Crucially, anticipate the steps an AI agent needs.** Don't assume implicit knowledge. If a file needs to be created, list it. If a specific function signature is required, note it. If specific CSS classes are needed, list them.
   - Each lowest-level checkbox should represent a distinct, small, verifiable action.

3. **Detail & Clarity:**

   - For each task, provide enough context or reference (e.g., "Implement function `calculateTotal` as specified in productRequirements.md section 4.2.1," "Create React component `UserProfileCard` based on userStories.md #15 acceptance criteria").
   - Specify _what_ needs to be done, _where_ (e.g., which file, which component), and any key parameters or expected outcomes based on the input documents.
   - Include tasks for setup, configuration, error handling, logging, and testing as derived from the requirements (projectSpecification.md, productRequirements.md).
   - Explicitly list tasks for writing unit tests, integration tests, and any necessary documentation updates related to the code being generated.

4. **Completeness:**

   - Ensure _all_ functional and non-functional requirements (from projectSpecification.md/productRequirements.md) are covered by corresponding checklist items.
   - Include steps for setting up the development environment if specified or implied by the tech stack (productRequirements.md/projectSpecification.md).
   - Cover deployment steps if detailed in the deploymentPlan.md document.

5. **AI Agent Focus:**
   - Write instructions clearly and unambiguously, assuming the reader is a logical AI agent. Avoid colloquialisms or vague instructions.
   - The goal is to minimize the need for the AI agent to infer steps or make assumptions. The checklist should be its definitive guide.

**Output Format:**

- A single, comprehensive Markdown file.
- Extensive use of nested checklists (`- [ ]`).
- Clear hierarchical structure using Markdown headings.

**Emphasis:** The success of the AI Coding Agent depends entirely on the extreme detail and accuracy of this checklist. **Do not omit any step, no matter how small.** Think through the entire development process from setup to completion based _only_ on the provided project documents. If details are missing in the source documents, note the assumption or the need for clarification within the checklist item itself.

**Output File:** Save the generated Implementation Checklist as `project_docs/implementationChecklist.md`.
